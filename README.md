# MLOPS END TO END PROJECT WITH GITHUB ACTIONS
  ## This repository was created for these purposes and is a final project for the MLOps Bootcamp(September-2023) taken within the scope of Istanbul Data Science.
## Purpose of CI/CD MLOps Project with Github Actions 
First purpose is to provide a framework for effectively developing, deploying and managing machine learning models.
To mention in more detail;
* The CI process increases the speed of software development. Every new code change is automatically integrated and potential errors are detected at an early stage during merge operations. This allows developers to get feedback quickly and fix bugs earlier.
* The CD process involves the automated testing and deployment of validated and integrated code. In the model development process, CD enables fast and secure deployment of trained models to production environments. This provides the ability to deliver faster innovations to customers.
* MLOps manages the lifecycle of the model. This includes all steps from training to deployment. The ability to monitor the performance of the model, collect data in real time and track changes in the performance of the model is critical for updating and optimising the model.
* CI/CD processes include testing to ensure model consistency and reliability. This ensures that models maintain their expected performance and reduces the risk of new updates causing unexpected side effects.
* CI/CD processes increase collaboration between development and operations teams. Continuous communication and co-operation ensures a more effective and smoother development process.

    Realising this goal can help a company or project team gain a competitive advantage by increasing their ability to react quickly, gain flexibility and adapt more quickly to customer feedback.
